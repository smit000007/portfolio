# EmailJS Setup Guide for Contact Form

This guide will help you set up EmailJS to receive emails from your contact form.

## Step 1: Create EmailJS Account

2. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Add Email Service

1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the authentication steps
5. Note down your **Service ID** (e.g., `service_abc123`)

## Step 3: Create Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template structure:

```html
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

Hello {{to_name}},

You have received a new message from your portfolio website:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

4. Save the template and note down your **Template ID** (e.g., `template_xyz789`)

## Step 4: Get Your Public Key

1. Go to "Account" â†’ "API Keys" in your dashboard
2. Copy your **Public Key** (e.g., `user_def456`)

## Step 5: Update Your Code

âœ… **CONFIGURATION COMPLETE!** Your EmailJS is now properly configured with:

```javascript
// EmailJS Configuration (Already set up)
emailjs.init("dQmrhnlupg0TUCIgL"); // Public Key
emailjs.send('service_e38iyv4', 'template_3nyenng', templateParams);
```

**Your current configuration:**
- **Public Key**: `dQmrhnlupg0TUCIgL`

4. Check your email for the message
5. Check the browser console for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"EmailJS is not defined" error**
   - Make sure the EmailJS CDN is loaded before your script.js
   - Check that the CDN link is working

2. **"Service not found" error**
   - Verify your Service ID is correct
   - Make sure your email service is properly connected

3. **"Template not found" error**
   - Verify your Template ID is correct
   - Make sure the template is published
